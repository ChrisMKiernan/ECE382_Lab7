## Lab 7 Robot Sensing

Objective: to utilize the IR sensors on the robot at certain thresholds.

### Prelab

What pins will I use? Some pins are already taken by my motor sensors, and I need to use pins that have ADC inputs. I also don't want to use P1.0 or P1.6 because those are my LED pins - the LED pins are useful for inidcating results of tests. For this lab, then, I will use P1.3, P1.4, and P1.5.
